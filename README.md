Hello INTEX judges and Teaching Assistants. We love you ðŸ’˜ðŸ’˜ðŸ’˜

We humbly submit this project as our INTEX project submission. We are really proud of what we accomplished this week and hope that you appreciate it as well.

## Project Setup
Our project is a ASP.NET core MVC application. Some important architectural things to note:
- Our controllers access the databases directly, rather than using a repository.
- For an encrypted database connection the .pem file in the root directory is necessary.
- Because database credentials are not uploaded to github, you will not be able to establish a connection to our DB cloning our code.
